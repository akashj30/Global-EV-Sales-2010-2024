## Global-EV-Sales-2010-2024
Electric vehicles, marked by early innovations, periods of decline, and a remarkable resurgence in recent decades. From the pioneering efforts of the 19th century to the transformative breakthroughs of the 21st century, EVs have continually evolved, driven by technological advancements, environmental considerations, and shifting market dynamics.

I also examine the various types of electric vehicles currently available, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Each of these powertrains offers unique advantages and challenges, reflecting the diverse needs and preferences of todayâ€™s drivers.

Through data visualisations and analysis, I present a snapshot of global EV trends, showcasing the growth of EV sales and the distribution of different powertrain types across regions. As we look towards the future, the Global EV Outlook underscores the potential of electric mobility to reshape the transportation landscape and drive us toward a more sustainable and innovative future.
